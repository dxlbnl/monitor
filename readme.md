## Controllers

A service aimed to do one thing, they should be small
They subscribe to a queue, and process tasks
The tasks also include critical components of the monitor itself, that's why they should leave health checks.

An example is the cron service, it reads it's configuration table and dispatches tasks on target queues.
It could dispatch a curl command to fetch a health status endpoint
